PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022ACTING GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

In 2022, COVID-19 still impacted the way we worked and lived in multiple  ways  and  climate  change  remained  one  of  the  most  imminent  global  threats. As a technology, media and telecommunications leader which has  been serving our community for more than 150 years, we further stepped  up our risk management and governance while expanding our support to  the community in this critical time to safeguard the sustainable development  of both our business and community at large.

Led  by  our  Board,  we  have  championed  environmental,  social  and  governance  ("ESG")  as  guiding  principles  for  our  Corporate  strategy,  integrated  into  every  aspect  of  our  business.  Embracing  ESG  through  a  double materiality lens, we have prioritised issues that are both financially  material  to  our  company  and  important  to  our  internal  and  external  stakeholders.

As a technology business, we have placed the utmost emphasis on customer  data  privacy  and  protection,  while  information  security  and  management  remained  imperative  at  every  level  of  our  organisation.  As  our  customers  put their trust in us, we recognised the protection of their information as  vital,  taking  Cybersecurity  readiness  very  seriously  to  meet  the  growing  challenges.

In terms of the environment, the Group has continued to strengthen its climate resilience through implementing control measures  and leveraging technological innovations to safeguard the well-being of our business operations and safety of employees. We  remain  determined  to  achieve  targets  on  reducing  our  electricity  consumption,  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  water  and  waste  consumption by 2025, in line with the Government’s strategic focuses outlined in Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan. To that end,  we have been progressively increasing the adoption of renewable energy and advanced technology solutions, including artificial  intelligence ("AI") and Internet of Things ("IoT") to attain higher energy efficiency in our operations. We have also provided our  customers with electric vehicle charging services and Integrated Smart Energy Solution to reduce their carbon footprint.

For community as a whole, besides mobilising our resources to help the city staying connected during the pandemic so that  people  can  continue  to  work,  live,  learn  and  receive  medical  support,  we  have  also  been  devoted  to  the  promotion  of  5G  technology,  digital  payment  and  telemedicine  services  to  accelerate  Hong  Kong’s  transformation  into  a  smart  city.  More  importantly, amidst the pandemic, our long-term efforts to bridge the digital divide by providing tailored services to the elderlies  has become more meaningful, especially when various COVID-19 related digital applications, such as LeaveHomeSafe, are essential  in everyday life.

Our people are our most important asset. We have dedicated ourselves to fostering an environment supporting diversity, equality  and inclusion as well as continuous upskilling and learning, which are key to attracting and retaining talent in an increasingly  competitive market.

Forging ahead with purpose and a clear vision in the long term, we will not only continue to enhance our ESG performance  and  disclosures,  for  example,  by  adopting  international  standards  such  as  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative’s  ("GRI")  Universal  Standards, but also strive to leverage our expertise to create more shared value for our stakeholders and community. I thank all  our employees, management team and our Board for their full support as we pursue our ESG journey.

Group Risk Management & Compliance ("GRM&C") as the second line of defence, performs a supervision role in ERM to provide  advisory support to enable risk and compliance oversight of the first line of defence, while ascertaining the relevant embedded  controls are effective. Being the risk owners, FUs and BUs identify, evaluate, mitigate and monitor their own risks, and report  such risk assessment process to GRM&C on a regular basis. Through supervising the ERM activities, GRM&C assesses and reviews  significant aspects of the Group’s risk exposures. The identified material risks and corresponding mitigation measures will be  reported to the Audit Committee regularly to ensure proper management of all significant risks (including sustainability risks) of  the Group.10

Sustainability Risks and Climate Change In recent decades, climate change has posed physical climate risks to the global community through more frequent extreme  weather events. Consequently, more stringent policy requirements towards decarbonisation are expected to drive the adoption  of low-carbon technology, exposing our business operations to transition climate risks. The Group has been enhancing its climate  resilience through technological innovations and implementing control measures to mitigate these climate risks to enable the  continuity of Group’s business operations. 

For further information on the ERM framework and methodology, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report of PCCW’s Annual Report 2022.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022  Listed below are our responses on various sustainability initiatives we have implemented to raise awareness and combat climate  change:

Responding to Climate Change

Nature of Risk

Impact

Our Response

Acute Physical Risk

Risks that are driven by  extreme weather events,  such as typhoons, heavy  rainfall, and floods.

Increased frequency and  severity of extreme weather  events may lead to disruption  of network operations and  telecommunication service.

We have installed IoT sensors in  flooding alarm system which help us  to monitor the water level in various  locations and allow timely response for  remedial actions. Besides, emergency  plan or contingency plans are in place  to provide guidance on severe weather  conditions.

Chronic Physical Risk

Risks associated with  longer-term shifts in  climate patterns, such  as sustained high  temperature, change in  precipitation patterns.

Policy and Legal Risk

Policy actions that  attempt to constrain  actions that contribute  to the adverse effects of  climate change.

Long-term shifts in climate  patterns have potential  impact on our infrastructure  and facilities, which may lead  to disruption of our services  provision and business  continuity.

Our technical team will closely  monitor the network equipment  functionality and ensure that  the cooling equipment is in  good condition especially when  temperature increases.

More stringent policy  requirements towards  decarbonisation and other  environmental-related  targets, which require to put  in additional transition efforts  for compliance.

Technology Risk

Risk associated with  technologies used in the  transition to a lower- carbon economy.

The use of low-carbon  technologies may increase  the Group’s operating cost.

Reputation Risk

Risk of changing  customer and/or public  perceptions of our  contributions to a lower- carbon economy.

The Group’s reputation may  be adversely affected if it  cannot meet customers and/ or public expectations.

The Group supports Hong Kong’s  Climate Action Plan 2050 with  various climate initiatives and  measures implemented. We will  keep abreast of the latest regulatory  development to ensure compliance  with the applicable laws and  regulations in the jurisdictions in  which we operate.

We have adopted digital solutions  and smart technologies to enhance  the energy efficiency and resources  conservation in our building and  facility management. The Group  has taken proactive steps to adopt  renewable energy and promote the  use of electric vehicles ("EVs").

As a conglomerate with global  footprint, our success depends on the  trust of our customers, stakeholders,  and the public at large. The Group  has been actively engaging with  our stakeholders to understand  their expectations and strive to  enhance our ESG performance and  disclosures.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 20221.3 Sustainability Policies

The Group is committed to observing high standard of governance and integrity in all aspects of our business. We review the  Group policies regularly to ensure that we adhere to the latest applicable laws and regulations. All employees are expected to  strictly comply with Group’s policies and procedures when acting on behalf of the Group, whether dealings with customers,   third parties, regulators, authorities, or the general public.

The  Board  via  RMCCC  has  endorsed  a  number  of  policies  to  ensure  full  awareness  of  proper  governance  and  compliance  responsibilities across different FUs and BUs.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 20221.4 Business Ethics

We recognise the value in building trust with our global business partners and stakeholders through transparency. The Group  places  great  importance  on  conducting  business  ethically  with  an  effective  framework  of  corporate  governance  in  place.  As  a responsible business operator, we strictly adhere to the Group’s ethical standards and comply  with all applicable laws  and  regulations  in  different  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  Guided  by  the  comprehensive  scope  of  the  Group  policies  and  procedures, all Group members, including directors, officers, and employees, must adhere to a set of behaviour standards that  goes beyond the local statutory requirements.

Anti-bribery and Corruption

The  Board  has  zero  tolerance  towards  any  form  of  bribery  and  corruption  at  any  level  in  association  with  any  aspect  of the Group’s activities. Our Anti-Bribery and  Corruption  ("ABC")  Policy provides principles for  all directors,  officers,  employees, and external parties acting in any capacity on behalf of the Group to conduct business with integrity and  honesty and to reduce the risk of corruption. Furthermore, an ABC Procedure Manual ("Procedure Manual") has been  developed to provide detailed guidance on mitigating potential bribery and corruption risks in conjunction with the ABC  Policy while maintaining the highest possible ethical standards and vigorously enforcing its business practices, whenever  it operates throughout the world. In case of any doubt as to whether any misbehaviour or unusual business transaction  could lead to bribery and corrupt practices, employees are urged to refer to the Procedure Manual. The Procedure Manual  is proportionate to and focused on the risks that we face, including those arising from its associated parties. In addition,  offering or promising to give or accept any gift or hospitality to reward or retain a business, or recognise any bribery or  corruption in any business dealings that involve the Group, government officials, our customers, suppliers, or employees  are  strictly  prohibited.  As  a  technology  conglomerate  with  a  footprint  worldwide,  we  strictly  adhere  to  global  anti- corruption laws such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, which is internationally recognised as one of the highest  ABC standards and forms the basis of our Policy and Procedure Manual.

Anti-money Laundering and Counter-terrorist Financing

Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") and Counter-Terrorist Financing ("CTF") Policy have been established by the Group. All  subsidiaries, employees and associated parties of the Group are required to follow an effective and systematic AML and  CTF framework in their business dealings and daily operations. To ensure strict compliance with all applicable laws and  regulations, risk assessments and monitoring activities are undertaken regularly at the BU level. In the event of conflict  of interest, employees are required to seek clarification from their line managers. Application and declaration forms are  available on our intranet.1

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022    Whistleblowing

A high standard of corporate governance is maintained by the Group, in accordance with which ethics, transparency,  accountability,  and  integrity  are  upheld  in  all  areas  of  its  operations  without  compromising  the  interests  of  its  shareholders. All internal and external stakeholders are encouraged to report actual or suspected improper conduct in  confidence to the Audit Committee via Group Internal Audit.

All  whistleblowing  cases  are  treated  in  strict  confidence  accordance  with  the  procedures  set  out  in  the  Group’s  Whistleblower  Policy  and  Procedures  Manual,  which  are  periodically  reviewed  and  updated.  Senior  employees  are  designated  to  act  as  the  case  manager  on  behalf  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Audit  Committee,  such  as  the  Head  of  Group Internal Audit. The case manager is responsible for the case’s conduct, management, and reporting. Once the  investigation is complete, a report is submitted to the RMCCC for consideration and further reporting, as appropriate,  to the Audit Committee. The report context includes its final disposition, impact, implications, and recommendations for  improvement, if applicable.

Data Privacy

We have strict internal policies, procedures, and compliance guidelines in governing how we collect, use and manage  customer information. These policies and guidelines have clearly defined roles and responsibilities of handling personal  data, and stipulate appropriate security measures to achieve confidentiality, integrity, and accountability.

The Group Privacy Compliance Officer is responsible for monitoring regulatory compliance with all matters relating to  personal data, and further enhancing our security policies and standards if needed. A Data Protection Impact Assessment  ("DPIA")  is  conducted  before  we  enter  into  business  in  a  new  country  or  introduce  any  new  product  or  service.  The  DPIA identifies any data privacy risks in the business process, provides  a  basis on  which  to  assess and  implement the  corresponding risk-mitigating controls, and ensures our compliance with all data protection obligations.

Information Security

We adhere to the highest standards of cybersecurity practices in efforts to protect our customer privacy and our business  data. Our information security policies and guidelines are referenced to industrial best practice including ISO 27001. The  Group periodically reviews such guidelines to ensure its effectiveness.

At  the  Group  level,  the  Group  Information  and  Cybersecurity  Council  ("GICSC")  oversees  all  cybersecurity-related  initiatives, investments and ongoing maintenance pertaining to the protection of the Group’s core infrastructure including  networks, servers and endpoints. The GICSC reports directly to top management on any cybersecurity matters requiring  escalation. Moreover, there are dedicated teams under the Group, known as the Group Information and Cybersecurity  Office,  responsible  for  reviewing  the  overall  cybersecurity  risk  profile  and  monitoring  suspicious  traffic  and  activity  to  combat cyberattacks. The team constantly reviews the latest development in cybersecurity to enhance our policies and  investment in capabilities and technologies to be well-equipped for timely response in the case of any newly identified  risk.

At the department level, some of our FUs and BUs have attained ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our efforts in  security management and our full commitment to data and information security. In order to ensure that we adhere to  the latest legal and regulatory requirements, we have established stringent internal policies that formalise and align these  requirements into our day-to-day operations.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022      Fostering Compliance Culture at All Levels

The Board has adopted the CR policy which serves as the overarching principles to be applied throughout the Group  with clear and concise guidelines to behaviours and corporate responsibilities of directors, officers and employees so as  to uphold a high level of standards of behaviour that go beyond minimum legal standards. All employees are required to  sign a declaration of acknowledgement in accordance with the CR policy. Violation of the Group’s policies, procedures  and guidelines may result in verbal or written warning or even lead to summary dismissal depending on the severity of the  infraction.

To reinforce our guiding principles and foster a culture of compliance across the Group, we provide ongoing compliance- related  training  to  all  FUs  and  BUs,  while  keeping  abreast  of  the  development  of  relevant  laws  and  regulations.  A  series of  risk management training workshops have been conducted for first-line  risk owners in FUs and BUs to raise  their  overall  awareness  and  ascertain  the  integration  of  sustainability-related  risks  and  opportunities  into  the  ERM  system. It is mandatory for all new employees to undergo induction training on risk and compliance, which covers ERM  and  Compliance,  ABC,  AML  &  CTF,  Whistleblower,  Data  Privacy,  Technology  Risk  &  Cybersecurity,  and  International  Trade  Compliance.  In  addition,  the  Group  has  reiterated  its  zero-tolerance  attitude  towards  bribery  and  corruption  by  introducing  Group  ABC  Policy  and  Procedure  Manual,  as  well  as  sharing  knowledge  on  relevant  global  laws  and  regulations to our employees through online training courses on a regular basis. Apart from the aforementioned topics,  the ABC training also covers items around third-party due diligence and management, warning signs and red flags, along  with other case studies with the objective to further raise our employees’ awareness of ABC in carrying out their daily  duties.

In 2022, we have neither concluded legal cases concerning non-compliance with the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (Cap.  201) and other applicable laws and regulations related to corruption, nor any legal cases concerned with corrupt practices  brought against the Group or its employees.

Materiality Matrix and Result With  the  consideration  of  the  above  communication  channels,  the  Group  has  also  taken  megatrend  and  peer  analysis  into  account  when  we  review  the  material  topics.  In  order  to  ensure  the  materiality  matrix  is  aligned  with  our  stakeholders’  expectations, we have invited both our internal and external stakeholders to share their opinions. Internally, we have solicited  feedback from the respective FU and BU heads, as well as selected members of their staff. Externally, we have engaged investors,  suppliers, contractors, corporate clients, business partners, academia, and community partners in this exercise.

We have identified the key material topics shown on the list on page 22. The top three key material topics this year are "Customer  data privacy and protection", "Information security and management" and "Anti-corruption" respectively while other material  topics remain relevant and significant to our stakeholders and businesses in 2022.

In addition, "Energy efficiency", "GHG emissions", and "Climate change" have been ranked higher by stakeholders in 2022  compared to 2021 as aligned with Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2050:

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022  To reflect on the international best practice in sustainability reporting, the Group has applied the concept of double materiality11  in its materiality assessment process. The financially material topics that management considered most likely to create or diminish  the Group’s enterprise value are as follows:

Financially Material Topics and their Impacts

Customer Data Privacy  and Protection

Information Security  and Management

Energy Efficiency

Safeguards sensitive personal data  and business information provided  by customers in the day-to-day  operations

Establishes information security  management system for FUs and  BUs to identify, evaluate, mitigate,  and monitor their risks exposures in  minimising cybersecurity threat

Reviews management system, energy  consumption targets and upgrade  equipment/facilities to improve  energy efficiency and reduce energy  consumption

Financial Impact Loss in revenue and/or market share,  legal costs, etc

Financial Impact Loss in revenue lost and/or market  share, costs arising from service  blackout/disruption

Financial Impact Energy costs, investments in energy  efficient technologies/upgrades (e.g.  power metres with IoT solutions)

Responses to the Stakeholders During our materiality assessment exercise, we have received many valuable comments from our stakeholders on major ESG issues.  Below are our responses to some of key comments from stakeholders this year:

Environment Electricity and Power Consumption

Q1:  An increase in demand for  communications and services  may drive electricity and power  consumption to a higher level. How  does the Group commit to such  conservation?

Our response:

The Group has set several environmental targets for 2025 and  conducts series of annual review to evaluate our performance  against  those  targets.  To  reduce  our  electricity  and  power  consumption, we have been exploring different energy saving  options internally and externally. In 2022, we have reduced the  air conditioner usage at our data centres while switching off  our 2G wireless network. While within our office premises, we  have  installed  automatic  sensors  for  lighting  and  dismantled  additional fluorescent tubes in buildings to reduce power and  electricity consumption.

For more details, please refer to the "Enhancing the Group’s  Environmental Resilience and Agility" chapter of this report.

The  concept  of  double  materiality  encourages  a  company  to  judge  materiality  from  two  perspectives  1)  "the  extent  necessary  for an  understanding  of  the 

company’s development, performance and position" and "in the broad sense of affecting the value of the company"; 2) environmental and social impact of the 

company’s activities on a broad range of stakeholders. The concept also implies the need to assess the interconnectivity of the two.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022Social Talent Retention & Development

Q2:  Due to the competitive labour  market, there is inherent difficulty  to attract the right talent.  How does the Group respond  to this issue with the current  talent acquisition, training, and  development programmes?

Our response: 

We  have  recognised  that  talent  shortage  may  hinder  our  business  development.  Therefore,  we  utilise  ample  of  resources  to  strengthen  our  talent  pool,  in  particular  to  the  technology industry and foster our talent development across  the Group. Since 2022, we have launched Skills Hub, a virtual  learning platform to facilitate employees continuous learning  at  anywhere  and  anytime.  In  addition,  we  have  piloted  the  "Collaborate & LEAD programme" to enhance our colleagues’  leadership skills.

For more details, please refer to the "Becoming an Employer  of Choice" chapter of this report.

Governance Communications on Sustainability Strategy

Q3:  PCCW is a technology  conglomerate with diverse  businesses and a large group  of stakeholders. How does  the Group foster effective  communication and alignment on  sustainability strategy across the  Group and its stakeholders?

Our response: 

The  Board,  our  highest  governing  body,  is  responsible  for  the  supervision  of  the  Group’s  sustainability  strategy.  The  Sustainability Committee takes on the responsibility to monitor  and  report  the  implementation  of  sustainability-related  policies and procedures across the Group, while assisting top  management’s  decision-making  and  providing  guidance  to  the  working  groups/teams  to  implement  best  sustainability  practices  and  initiatives  in  our  day-to-day  operations.  Our  respective  board  level  committees  meet  regularly  to  review  the Group’s performance, which accurately reflect the needs  and concerns of our stakeholders. We also communicate our  sustainability  strategy  with  external  stakeholders  through  ongoing stakeholder engagement.

For more details, please refer to the "Sustainability at PCCW"  chapter of this report.

With digital services becoming a daily necessity for the general public, HKT is committed to equip senior citizens with necessary  knowledge and skills to live a modern digital lifestyle. Thus, we have launched a range of mobile service plans such as the "Smart  Pama Service Plan" and "Elderly Smart Watch Service Plan" to combat the challenges that the elderlies may face with modern  technology.

Smart Pama Service Plan – Supporting the Elderlies’ Digital Needs  Caused by COVID-19

In Hong Kong, the proportion of citizens aged 65 and over in the total population rose from 13% in 2011 to 20% in  2021, which means 1 in 5 persons in the city is an elderly. Smart Pama Service Plan is a commercial service that provides  holistic  technical  support  and  discounts  to  the  elderlies  through  a  Smart  Pama  24-hour  service  hotline,  ambassador  programmes in retail stores, free call filtering, and workshops to help them fully enjoy their digital devices including  smartphones and tablets as well as learning the useful functions such as photography and social media.

Under the influence of COVID-19, there have been many special digital measures which the elderlies have to learn and  adapt to maintain their daily life, such as using the LeaveHomeSafe app before entering restaurants, clinics, wet markets  and even shopping malls. The Smart Pama Service Plan has promptly added  to  these range of offerings and helped  our senior members adjusting to this unexpected "digital transformation". The programme has served over 100,000  elderlies as of 2022.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022                    6.2 Enhancing Energy Efficiency

A  major  part  of  our  energy  consumption  is  for  powering  communication  and  connectivity  through  our  telecommunications  network and data centres. We are committed to the proper management of our energy consumption. We have been a signatory  to the Energy Saving Charter and the Charter on External Lighting, which have been established by the Environment and Ecology  Bureau since 2016. A few key energy saving measures are highlighted below:

•  Utilised Integrated Smart Solution to regulate the load of our buildings by achieving close to 10 % of energy savings

Introduced a total of eight Euro 6 vehicles and three electric cars

•  Applied solar-prevention materials to reduce heat in rooms during daytime

•  Adopted  retro-commissioning  to  optimise  energy  usage  without  replacing  existing  equipment,  including  switching  off  non-essential  display  monitors  in  24-hour  operation  centres,  maintaining  optimal  temperature  between  24°C  and  26°C,  shortening the operating hours of air conditioners and lights in some offices and installing occupancy sensors in various office  locations, staircases, and carparks

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 20226.3 Renewable Energy Adoption

To echo our decarbonisation strategy and promote the use of renewable energy, we have participated in CLP’s Renewable Energy  Feed-in Tariff Scheme.

Since our first installation of solar PV panels on the rooftop of our Junk Bay Exchange in 2021, we have been progressively  increasing the consumption of renewable energy in our network infrastructure. We have also commenced the installation  of solar power system at Shek O Exchange and is currently work-in-progress. Around 10% of the electricity that the Tin  Shui Wai Exchange consumed during 2022 has been generated from the solar panels on its roof. Looking forward, we  will continue to explore the feasibility of adopting more renewable energy sources for our operations to reduce carbon  emissions.

As of 31 December 2022, renewable energy has been generated from the following solar power systems:

•  Junk Bay Exchange •  Tin Shui Wai Exchange •  Lai Chi Kok Exchange

The solar power systems at Tin Shui Wai Exchange

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 20226.4 Waste Management

The  Group  prioritises  responsible  and  sustainable  consumption  behaviours.  We  have  implemented  strict  waste  management  instructions  to  ensure  proper  waste  handling  and  disposal  procedures.  We  regularly  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  our  waste  management approach, including reuse, recycling, reprocessing and responsible waste disposal, based on the waste hierarchy  principle. We have also carried out a biennial solid waste audit for our offices in PCCW Tower. The audit shows a comprehensive  overview of waste generation in our operations and provides us with insights into those improvement areas for achieving better  waste management.

Hazardous Waste For  hazardous  waste  such  as  fluorescent  tubes,  industrial  batteries,  waste  electrical  and  electronic  equipment  ("WEEE")  and  general  office  batteries  are  handled  by  approved  chemical  waste  collectors  and  specialist  contractors.  The  Group  has  been  providing complimentary removal services for our customers whenever they purchase regulated electrical equipment in response  to the Government’s Producer Responsibility Scheme for WEEE. The collected waste equipment is sent to certified recyclers for  proper treatment to enable resource recovery. Since 2022, we have assisted customers removing more than 1,600 pieces of  WEEE. When our  customers replace their mobile devices, we also offer trade-in and preliminary  valuation services to reduce  waste generation and promote a circular economy.

Furthermore, we have collected and recycled over 5,000 old mobile handsets and accessories from customers for donation to  Caritas Computer Workshops since 2022. During the same year, we have also collaborated with Hong Kong Battery Recycling  Centre to recycle waste lead acid batteries locally. Since 2022, a total of 215.16 tonnes of waste industrial batteries has been  recycled.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022  Non-hazardous Waste Non-hazardous waste is in general handled by professional cleaning service providers and contractors in compliance with local  regulations. The two main types of non-hazardous waste include waste from office and construction waste from the renovation  of our retail outlets. Our office furniture is reused following shop relocation and renovation whenever possible to minimise waste  generation.

Paper is a major source of waste across our operations and value chain. As part of our commitment to paperless billing, we have  digitalised billing services for our customers over the past few years. By encouraging our customers to switch to electronic bills  for our various services, we have saved over 73 million sheets of paper. Whenever paper is required by customers or for specific  reasons, only paper that is certified for the Endorsement of Forest Certification will be used.

Further to paper waste management, the Group has extended its non-hazardous waste reduction effort to our canteens. Since  2022,  we  have  phased  out  single-use  materials  such  as  plastic  straws  and  cutlery  in  four  canteens  and  offered  eco-friendly  alternatives instead. To better manage our municipal solid waste, we have launched a food waste recycling programme to collect  food waste in our staff canteen in Lai Chi Kok Exchange since 1 October 2022. Looking forward, we aim at reducing food waste  disposal rate by further reducing overproduction and recycling.

6.5 Water Management

Guided  by  our  Energy  and  Water  Management  Policy  and  Guidelines,  the  Group  is  committed  to  conserving,  reducing,  and  reusing water in our operations. Since 2022, we have installed water-cooled condensers for collecting wastewater for flushing  and sensors on the faucet to proactively identify water-saving opportunities and control water consumption.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 20226.6 Sustainable Finance

To  integrate  our  ESG  philosophy  in  our  funding  objectives,  we  have  actively  engaged  in  issuing  sustainability-linked  finance  instruments.  This  reinforces  our  long-term  commitment  to  mobilise  corporate  actions  towards  a  greener  future  and  create  sustainable value to our stakeholders.

As  at  31  December  2022,  the  Group  has  over  US$2  billion  of  sustainability-linked  loans  raised  from  financial  institutions. KPIs have been used to evaluate the Group’s sustainability performance, including GHG emissions, energy  consumption and waste management. To assess our environmental impacts and optimise the financing terms, the  performance data has been closely tracked against the agreed environmental targets on an annual basis.

Green and Sustainable Deposits

During 2022, we have continued to place our liquidity in green and sustainable deposits with financial institutions.  Our participation in the deposit schemes has enabled us to work together with the financial community in supporting  ESG-oriented  projects  and  organisations,  and  accelerating  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon,  climate-resilient  and  sustainable economy.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 20227.  NETTING THE VALUE 

CHAIN

Working with value chain partners is one of the core practices of the Group’s sustainability  strategy. Our transformation and sustainability goals depend largely on long-term and  constructive relationships with our suppliers. As a founding member of the Sustainable  Procurement Charter established by the Green Council, we are committed to sourcing and   monitoring suppliers who are committed and adhered to adopting sustainable practices.

Source from Responsible Suppliers

Strengthen Collaboration with Local  Suppliers

•  Reinforced strict compliance to the 

•  Encouraged sustainable procurement by 

sourcing from local where possible

Supplier Code of Conduct •  Adopted continuous supplier 

management and assessment to  monitor their performance

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 20227.1 Supplier Code of Conduct

The Group has established the Supplier Code of Conduct (the "Code") to set out clear expectations for our suppliers to maintain  the same underlying principles for conducting business ethically in line with global compliance standards. The Code is publicly  available on our Group’s official website and covers a wide range of topics including:

•  Legal and Regulatory Compliance •  Anti-bribery and Corruption •  Labour Guidance •  Occupational Health and Safety •  Conflict of Interest •  Environment Management •  Supplier Diversity •  Engagement with the Group Strategic Purchasing •  Evidence and Review

We review the Code from time to time in order to stay abreast of the latest applicable laws and regulations. To ensure and  maintain a common standard of ethical conduct and compliance requirements across the Group, training has been provided to  both new and existing employees on procurement, supply chain management procedures as well as the understanding of related  policies to ensure our prevailing procurement practices and protocols are strictly followed.

The Group has also formulated and adopted a set of Group Purchasing Policy and Principles ("GPPP") for supplier selection and  management process. The GPPP not only provides guidance to facilitate the implementation of control points on each of the  supply chain processes to transform the Group into a responsible organisation, it also sets out criteria for the Group to manage  the procurement practices effectively and align with our corporate and social responsibilities.

7.2 Continuous Supplier Assessment

We actively review our engagements with suppliers and their standards by adhering to the GPPP. To achieve a higher standard,  we  have  attained  the  ISO  9001:2015  quality  management  system  certification  to  continue  monitoring  our  supply  chain  management and the performance of our suppliers.

Supplier Selection We  have  adopted  a  stringent  approach  before  engaging  new  suppliers.  Suppliers  are  requested  to  complete  the  Vendor  Registration Form, which contains an assessment on their quality assurance, state of ESG performance and corporate governance.  Sustainability-related terms are included in our standard procurement contracts that require suppliers to adhere to compliance  of environmental and OSH regulations in line with Group’s standards and practices. As part of our screening process, we require  new  suppliers  to  provide  relevant  environmental  and  social  documents  as  evidence  to  demonstrate  their  commitments  on  embedding ESG related initiatives in their operations.

Supplier Assessment FUs and BUs are required to conduct and evaluate supplier performance on a regular basis, including their quality of delivery and  their operations impact on the environment, people, and communities they serve.

As part of the ongoing supplier assessment, the Group also conducts quarterly review to evaluate the sustainability practices  employed  by  our  existing  suppliers.  In  order  to  promote  sustainable  procurement,  the  Group  will  request  corrective  actions  from any suppliers who receives an unsatisfactory rating during the review. If the supplier consistently fails to comply with our  standards, we may consider terminating the engagement or, in extreme cases, blacklisting the supplier. Since 2022, visits at 76  suppliers have been conducted.

PCCW Environmental, Social and Governance Report 20227.3 Sustainable Procurement

As  a  founding  member  of  the  Sustainable  Procurement  Charter  established  by  the  Green  Council,  we  are  committed  to  promoting  sustainable  procurement  practices  by  monitoring  suppliers’  environmental  and  social  compliance  as  well  as  their  sustainability risk profile, together with continual improvement. This charter also provides a cohesive platform for those who are  interested in sustainability working collectively towards by one of the UNSDGs on Responsible Consumption and Production.

Sourcing from local production is one of the effective ways to reduce carbon footprint, particularly on GHG emissions attributed  to transportation and logistics. Amongst our 4,751 suppliers during 2022, about 80% of them are based in Hong Kong.

Distribution of Suppliers by Geographical Locations

Appendix 2: Reporting Guidance on Environmental KPIs" published by HKEX.

The total number of full-time equivalent ("FTE") employees in Hong Kong is 12,385 as of 31 December 2022. Consistent with that of the prior years, the Group 

has used the total number of FTE employees in Hong Kong as the basis for the intensity calculations of energy, electricity, GHG emissions, water and waste to 

facilitate the tracking progress of our environmental targets.

The revenue of the Group presented is used as the basis for energy, electricity, GHG emissions, water and waste intensity calculations, while the comparative 

revenue figures in 2021 was restated in accordance with the latest PCCW’s results announcement. As a result, the intensity calculations in 2021 were restated

Mechanical Services Department ("EMSD") of the Hong Kong SAR Government, unless otherwise stated in the following notes.

Scope 1 emissions comprise HFC and PFC emissions from the use of refrigerants and emissions from our standby emergency generators and vehicle fleet that run 

on diesel as well as our other vehicle fleet that runs on petrol. The global warming potentials used for calculation are adopted from Intergovernmental Panel on 

Climate Change ("IPCC") Fifth Assessment Report.

Scope 2 emissions are generated from the electricity consumed by PCCW’s major operations with individual meters. Emissions factors are adopted from the latest 

sustainability reports of local power companies.

The figures on Scope 3 emissions are generated from office paper consumption, water consumption and sewage discharge.

The emission factors for freshwater processing and sewage processing are adopted from the latest annual report of the Water Supplies Department and the 

sustainability report of the Drainage Services Department.
