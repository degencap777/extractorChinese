Partial Duration Hedged Share Classes intend to  provide investors a return that is less sensitive to interest  rate fluctuations by partially hedging the duration of the  overall Portfolio for shareholders in the Partial Duration  Hedged Share Class. Changes in interest rates will  influence the total return of such fixed-income portfolios.   The partial duration hedging strategy is designed to reduce,  however it may not eliminate, the interest rate risk of the  overall portfolio in the Partial Duration Hedged Share Class.  Managing the interest rate risk at the Partial Duration  Hedged Share Classes level does not affect the investment  management of the portfolio’s underlying assets since the  financial derivative instrument transactions used to hedge  the interest rate risk will be performed at the net asset value  (NAV) of the Partial Duration Hedged Share Classes.   Shareholders should be aware that Partial Duration Hedged  Share Classes may still have significant sensitivity to  changes in interest rates, which would impact the NAV of  the Partial Duration Hedged Share Class.  Such partial duration hedging strategy will be achieved  through the use of financial derivative instruments, such as  interest rate futures. Expenses incurred as a result of such  hedging activity will be borne on a pro rata basis by all  Partial Duration Hedged Share Classes issued within the  same portfolio.  Finally, shareholders should be aware that the level of  leverage of Partial Duration Hedged Share Classes will  automatically be higher than the expected level of leverage  disclosed for a specific portfolio. Indeed, such expected  level of leverage does not take into account the hedging  transactions used for the Partial Duration Hedged Share  Classes. ",

The swing pricing adjustment will generally not  exceed 2% of the original Net Asset Value of a Portfolio  under normal market conditions.

The Board will publish  such decision on the Fund’s website as soon as practicable  thereafter.  Investors are advised that the application of swing pricing  may result in increased volatility in a Portfolio’s valuation and  performance, and a Portfolio’s Net Asset Value may deviate  from the underlying investments’ performance on a particular  Business Day as a result of the application of swing pricing.  Typically, such adjustment will increase the Net Asset Value  per Share on a given Business Day when there are net  inflows into a Portfolio and decrease the Net Asset Value per  Share when there are net outflows.

Internal renminbi (CNY) is used inside  China only, is not freely convertible and is subject to  exchange controls. External renminbi (CNH) is used outside  China, can be owned by anyone and is freely tradeable  outside of China but still subject to control, limits and  availability. Currently, the exchange rate between CNY and  CNH is based on market supply and demand but with an  element of government management and control as well as  the potential for the government to impose or modify  restrictions on conversion of CNY to CNH. Thus the  portfolio’s investments in China are subject to an additional  layer of currency risk (between CNH and CNY), which will be  affected by market forces as well as government policies and  actions and can result in significant volatility and liquidity risk.
